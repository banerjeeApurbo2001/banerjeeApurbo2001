Talking about Personal Stuffs! :D

ğŸ‘‹ Hello , This is Apurba Banerjee
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in App Development
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning firebase. 
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few flutter projects.
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with flutter and Android developers for sort of learning contemprorary stuff
ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything in which you have expertise.
ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, but I may be slow to respond.
ğŸ“« How to reach me: apurbo.banerjee@yahoo.com
ğŸ˜„ I love teaching and sketching and might even go and play games rather than doing all this boring tech stuff
âš¡ Fun fact: CarrotsğŸ¥•ğŸ¥• just might turn you orange XD.


Well let's leave the remaining stuff as it is :P
